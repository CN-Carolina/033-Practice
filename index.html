        <div class="storyOne">
            Yesterday in class was really weird. First, instead of learning code <span class="volunteer1"></span> went on a long rant about how <span class="number1"></span>+<span class="number2"></span> equals <span class="subtracting"></span> even though we all know it equals <span class="adding"></span>. We all just nodded in a(n)<span class="adjective"></span> way. Then <span class="classmate1"></span> started screaming in the middle of class. We asked <span class="classmate1"></span> what was wrong and they said that they saw <span class="celebrity"></span> outside the window! <span class="classmate2"></span> said that was a lie, but then <span class="volunteer2"></span> suggested we all go see for ourselves.It turns out they were not lying! <span class="celebrity-again"></span> was standing there <span class="verb"></span>ing at the window. It turns out they really want to learn how to code too. What a wild day.
